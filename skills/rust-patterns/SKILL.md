# Rust Patterns

Pick a side. These are the rulings, not a tutorial.

## Core opinions

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Borrow, don't clone | Pass `&T` unless you must own. |
| Make illegal states unrepresentable | Model only valid states with enums. |
| `?` over `unwrap()` | Propagate; never panic in production paths. |
| Parse, don't validate | Convert unstructured input to typed structs at the boundary. |
| Newtype for type safety | Wrap primitives so arguments can't be swapped. |
| Iterators over loops | Declarative chains are clearer and often faster. |
| `#[must_use]` on `Result`-like returns | Force callers to handle them. |
| `Cow<'_, T>` for maybe-owned data | Skip allocation when borrowing suffices. |
| Exhaustive matching | No wildcard `_` on business-critical enums — the compiler should force new variants on you. |
| Minimal `pub` surface | `pub(crate)` for internals; re-export the public API from `lib.rs`. |

## Pick-a-side calls

- **Errors:** `thiserror` when callers must match on error variants (usually libraries); `anyhow` when errors are only reported or logged (usually apps). Not a hard split — they compose: `thiserror` types wrapped by `anyhow` at the boundary.
- **Polymorphism:** generics when types are known at compile time (no vtable); trait objects (`dyn`) for heterogeneous collections, plugins, or runtime-selected types.
- **API shape:** accept generic inputs (`impl IntoIterator`). Return a named concrete type from public library APIs (callers can't depend on `impl Trait` internals); `impl Iterator` is fine for app or internal code.
- **Builders:** once a struct mixes required and optional fields (3+), use a builder, not a 6-argument `new`.
- **Concurrency:** channels to pass values between independent tasks; `Arc<Mutex<T>>` only for short-lived shared mutable state.

## Unsafe

Every `unsafe` block gets a `// SAFETY:` comment above it stating the invariant and why it holds. No comment, no merge.

- Minimise `unsafe`; reach for a safe abstraction first.
- Never use `unsafe` to get past the borrow checker for convenience.
- Audit every `unsafe` block during review.

## Toolchain

`cargo fmt` before every commit; `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (warnings are errors). 4-space indent, 100-column max — both rustfmt defaults worth stating because a 120-col override is the usual drift.

## Naming

| Kind | Case |
|------|------|
| functions, methods, variables, modules, crates | `snake_case` |
| types, traits, enums, type parameters | `PascalCase` |
| constants, statics | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` |
| lifetimes | short lowercase (`'a`, `'de`) |

Organize modules by **domain, not by type** — `auth/`, `orders/`, `db/`, each with its own `mod.rs`. Never a `models/` + `services/` + `handlers/` split.

## API surface

- `let` by default; `let mut` only where mutation is required.
- Take `&str`, not `String`; `&[T]`, not `Vec<T>` — in function parameters. "Pass `&T`" is not enough: `&String` and `&Vec<T>` still force the caller to own a heap allocation you never needed.
- `impl Into<String>` for constructors that must own a `String` — callers pass `&str` or `String` and neither allocates twice.
- Add context on the way up: `.with_context(|| format!("failed to read {path}"))?`. An error without the path it failed on is a bug report you cannot action.
- **Sealed traits** — put a `Sealed` supertrait in a private module to block external implementations of a trait you must stay free to extend.
- A repository is a **trait**, and it carries `Send + Sync` the moment it crosses a thread or an async runtime — which, for a repository, is always. `pub trait OrderRepository: Send + Sync`.

## Security

- Secrets come from the environment (`std::env::var`), never a `const` in source.
- Parameterized queries only: `sqlx::query("... WHERE name = $1").bind(&name)`. Never `format!` a value into SQL.
- `cargo audit` (known CVEs), `cargo deny check` (licenses + advisories), `cargo tree -d` (duplicate deps).
- Never return internal paths, stack traces, or database errors to a client. Log the detail server-side; return a generic message.

## Platform traps

**macOS + maturin:** after building a `.so`, `syspolicyd` can block it silently — Python hangs on import, then dies by SIGKILL with no error. Fix: `codesign -f -s - path/to/_core.*.so` after the build. When a native extension import hangs, check code signing first.
